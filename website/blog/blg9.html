                i am often times very quiet, and no it's not cause i want to look mysterious or anything, that's just corny to me. it's mainly due to the fact that i'm anxiety prone and horribly awkward, so it's hard for me to actually talk to people the way i want. idk, i think of the way to talk in my head and it never comes out right, or people don't react the way i expect so i back track, it's not easy living like this, i wish it upon no one, and it seems i can't ever get out of it. (but i will try as fuck.) <br><br>

                my boss is a bitch, she yells at everyone and speaks disrespectfully to everyone therefor niggas quit or get fired, she's her biggest enemy. atp working there all fear has been removed when she yells at me, it means nothing to me even if i do get fired cause i don't know what i'm supposed to be afraid of, losing this job ??? i can find another job out there that will let me work. only thing that scares me is my birthday coming up on the 28th. (might kill myself before then (jk(/srs(notjk(jk)))) on the 28th i turn 18 and am gonna have to start paying 200 a month in bills, the stress is weighing heavy on me, i don't know what to do. i work so little days (saturday, sunday) due to the fact i use all my time to work on my artistic endevours, but sometimes it feels like im running out of time. even tho that's most likely not the case. idk, i want acidica to be known, or at least at 10k monthly, that's my goal for the future, im trying to hard to get there but it seems so far, only time will tell tho. anyway i think that's all for today, thanks for reading.
