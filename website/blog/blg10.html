                THE MOUSE
                <br><br>

                hello and welcome back, was i missed? did you do anything exciting? what was the world like while i was gone? did you become happy? did you fall into madness? did it consume you or did you consume it? do people know you? do people love you? have you had sex? is this your first time here? are you afraid? are you courageous? how does your anxiety treat you, friend? <br><br>

                these questions are the same questions you ask yourself every day, am i correct? though my soft spoken voice makes you feel okay, i can also be anything else but what you wish me to be.
                i am you, i am what you want, i am the you that you wish you'd be. is that true? i don't know. believe a lie from a creation on the internet, nonsense flies, exhibitionism, i fall prey to another online scheme. these things look so precious to me, i fall into the trap of the cycle, the cycle consumes me, i consume the cycle. i love(hate) the cycle, the cycle never loved me back. the cycle fakes it's love, destroying me, but i couldn't ever fake anything, it gives me real feeling, right? cycle, off press death ex arm long thru right spiral downard up heaven blue xxLL45. <br><br>

                believe everything i say, "but that made no sense!" you shout angrily. indeed, you cant catch a mouse until you peel back the first layer of paint. only after this step can you clean away the base coat to find plaster, etching away to find drywall, hammering away to lath, prying for stud, then staring to darkness within this 3 foot wide wall. and although you're afraid of tight spaces, you enter to find this mouse that's been scratching behind the wall for so long. after some time you notice the scratching stopped a long time ago, even before you took apart your wall. and eventually you come to the realization, not only did you destroy your wall, but there was no mouse to begin with.
